# karnaugh

The Karnaugh map (KM or K-map) is a method of simplifying Boolean algebra expressions.
The Karnaugh map reduces the need for extensive calculations by taking advantage of humans' pattern-recognition capability. 
It also permits the rapid identification and elimination of potential race conditions. The required Boolean results are transferred from a truth table onto a two-dimensional grid where, in Karnaugh maps, the cells are ordered in Gray code,
and each cell position represents one combination of input conditions. I used basic pattern recoginition techniques to generate karnaugh table solver based on the input given by the user
